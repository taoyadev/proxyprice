        <h2>What Are Mobile Proxies?</h2>
        <p>
          Mobile proxies route your traffic through IP addresses assigned by mobile network operators (MNOs) to cellular devices. These IPs originate from smartphones, tablets, and mobile hotspots connected to 3G, 4G LTE, and 5G networks from carriers like Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Vodafone, and regional operators worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
          The secret weapon of mobile proxies is <strong>Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT)</strong>. Unlike residential IPs where one household has one public IP, mobile carriers share each public IP among thousands of simultaneous users to conserve IPv4 addresses. When Instagram or TikTok sees a mobile IP, they know blocking it would affect thousands of legitimate users. This makes mobile IPs nearly unblockable and gives them the highest trust score of any proxy type.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mobile proxy providers source IPs through three methods: (1) <strong>Real device farms</strong> with physical smartphones and SIM cards, offering the most authentic fingerprints but highest costs; (2) <strong>SDK networks</strong> where mobile app users opt-in to share bandwidth, providing scale but variable quality; (3) <strong>Carrier partnerships</strong> for direct network access. Each method has tradeoffs between authenticity, pool size, and pricing.

        <h2>How Mobile Proxy Pricing Works</h2>
        <p>
          Mobile proxies are the most expensive proxy type, typically 2-5x the cost of residential proxies. The premium reflects infrastructure costs (real SIM cards, cellular data plans, device maintenance) and the unmatched trust level these IPs provide.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Bandwidth-based pricing</strong> in 2026 ranges from $15-50/GB for standard plans. Budget mobile proxy providers start around $15-20/GB while premium providers with real device farms and specific carrier targeting charge $30-50/GB. Enterprise rates for 100+ GB monthly can drop to $5-15/GB. This model suits variable workloads.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Port-based pricing</strong> charges $50-300/month per dedicated port (connection). Each port connects through a specific SIM card or device, giving you exclusive access to that carrier's IP pool. Ports typically include automatic rotation every few minutes and unlimited bandwidth within fair-use limits. Best for social media automation requiring consistent connection identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Time-based subscriptions</strong> offer all-you-can-use access for a flat monthly fee, typically $100-500/month. Watch for fair-use policies that may throttle after 50-100GB. Good for predictable, high-volume operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Carrier and location premiums</strong> significantly affect pricing. US carriers (Verizon, AT&T) cost 20-50% more than European or Asian carriers. 5G connections command premiums over 4G. City-level targeting costs more than country-level. Real device farms with verified fingerprints cost more than SDK-based pools.

        <h2>Best Use Cases for Mobile Proxies</h2>
        <p>
          Mobile proxies are essential when you need the highest level of trust and authenticity. Their premium cost is justified for tasks where residential or datacenter proxies face blocks or restrictions.
        </p>
        <ul class="use-case-list">
          <li><strong>Social media management:</strong> Manage multiple Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and Twitter accounts without triggering platform security. Mobile IPs match the expected access patterns of genuine mobile app users.</li>
          <li><strong>Ad verification:</strong> View mobile advertisements exactly as real users see them. Verify mobile ad placements, creatives, and landing pages across different carriers and locations.</li>
          <li><strong>App store optimization:</strong> Research app rankings, reviews, and competitor data from mobile-first app stores. Access mobile-specific search results and recommendations.</li>
          <li><strong>Mobile-first platforms:</strong> Access services and APIs that restrict or modify responses for non-mobile traffic. Many platforms serve different content to mobile users.</li>
          <li><strong>Sneaker and retail bots:</strong> Achieve higher success rates on limited releases. Retailers trust mobile traffic more than residential or datacenter connections.</li>
          <li><strong>Account creation:</strong> Register accounts on platforms with strict anti-fraud measures. Mobile IPs rarely appear on blacklists and pass device fingerprint validation.</li>
          <li><strong>Price monitoring:</strong> Access mobile-specific pricing that may differ from desktop. Some retailers offer mobile-only deals or dynamic pricing based on device type.</li>
          <li><strong>Sensitive data collection:</strong> Gather information from highly protected websites where residential proxies face challenges.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Mobile vs Residential Proxies</h2>
        <p>
          Both mobile and residential proxies provide authentic user IPs, but they differ in important ways that affect performance, cost, and use case fit.
        </p>
        <div class="comparison-grid">
          <div class="comparison-item">
            <h3>Trust and Detection</h3>
            <p>Mobile proxies carry the highest trust scores because mobile IPs are naturally shared among thousands of users through CGNAT. Blocking a mobile IP risks blocking legitimate customers. Residential IPs have good trust but are increasingly fingerprinted and blacklisted by aggressive anti-bot systems.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="comparison-item">
            <h3>Price Comparison</h3>
            <p>Mobile proxies cost 2-5x more than residential alternatives. Expect $20-50 per GB for mobile versus $5-15 per GB for residential. This premium reflects the infrastructure costs and scarcity of mobile IP access. Budget carefully based on your volume requirements.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="comparison-item">
            <h3>Speed and Latency</h3>
            <p>Residential proxies typically offer faster and more stable connections because they route through fixed broadband networks. Mobile proxies may experience variable latency depending on cellular network conditions, signal strength, and carrier congestion.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="comparison-item">
            <h3>When to Choose Mobile</h3>
            <p>Select mobile proxies for: social media automation, accessing mobile-first platforms, bypassing the most aggressive anti-bot systems, mobile ad verification, and any scenario where residential proxies face blocks. Use residential for general scraping and tasks where mobile trust is not required.</p>

        <li><strong>Rotation:</strong> Confirm rotation intervals and session controls.</li>
        <li><strong>Fair use:</strong> Check bandwidth policies and throttling.</li>
