        <h2>What Are ISP Proxies?</h2>
        <p>
          ISP proxies (also called static residential proxies) are a hybrid proxy type. The IP addresses are registered to consumer Internet Service Providers like Comcast, Spectrum, or BT, but they are physically hosted on servers in commercial data centers. This gives you the best of both worlds: residential-level trust with datacenter-level performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a website performs an ASN lookup on an ISP proxy, it sees a legitimate residential ISP rather than a hosting company. This bypasses most datacenter IP blocking. However, sophisticated fingerprinting systems may detect that the IP is hosted in a datacenter rather than a residential location through latency analysis or IP-to-location mapping.
        </p>
        <p>
          The key differentiator from regular residential proxies is <strong>persistence</strong>. ISP proxies are static, meaning you maintain the same IP address for weeks or months. This is crucial for building account reputation, maintaining authenticated sessions, and any task where IP consistency matters. Rotating residential proxies change IPs constantly, which can trigger security alerts on platforms that track user IP history.
        </p>
        <p>
          Providers acquire ISP proxies by purchasing or leasing IP blocks directly from Internet Service Providers or through complex partnerships with regional telcos. The limited supply of genuine ISP-registered addresses makes these proxies scarcer and more expensive than standard datacenter options, but significantly cheaper than mobile proxies.
        </p>

      <article class="guide-section">
        <h2>How ISP Proxy Pricing Works</h2>
        <p>
          ISP proxy pricing sits between datacenter and residential costs. The static assignment model means you typically pay per-IP rather than per-GB, making costs predictable for high-bandwidth operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Per-IP monthly subscriptions</strong> are the standard model. In 2026, market rates range from $2-5/IP for budget providers to $5-15/IP for premium ISP proxies with clean history. Unlike rotating residential pools, you pay for specific IPs that remain exclusively yours for the subscription period. Volume discounts can reduce rates by 30-50% at 100+ IPs.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Bandwidth policies</strong> vary significantly between providers. Some offer truly unlimited bandwidth with per-IP pricing. Others cap bandwidth at 20-100GB per IP monthly, with overages charged at $0.50-2/GB. Always check the fine print. For bandwidth-heavy operations, "unlimited" per-IP plans provide the best value.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Geographic availability</strong> affects both pricing and options. US and Western European ISP proxies are most common and competitively priced. Asian and South American ISP proxies are scarcer and command 20-50% premiums. City-level targeting within the US/EU adds 10-30% to the base price.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Commitment requirements</strong> are common. Monthly minimums range from $50-200 depending on the provider. Some require 3-6 month commitments for access to premium IP blocks or the best per-IP rates. Pay-as-you-go options exist but at 20-40% higher rates.

        <h2>Best Use Cases for ISP Proxies</h2>
        <p>
          ISP proxies excel in scenarios requiring stable identity, speed, and residential-level trust. Their static nature and datacenter-grade performance make them ideal for specific professional applications.
        </p>
        <ul class="use-case-list">
          <li><strong>E-commerce operations:</strong> Manage seller accounts on Amazon, eBay, Walmart, and other marketplaces. Maintain consistent IPs to avoid triggering account verification or suspension.</li>
          <li><strong>Social media management:</strong> Operate multiple accounts on Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, and other platforms with stable IPs that do not trigger suspicious activity flags.</li>
          <li><strong>Ticketing and reservations:</strong> Access ticket platforms and booking sites for monitoring and purchasing. Static IPs avoid the rate limiting that affects rotating proxies.</li>
          <li><strong>Brand protection:</strong> Monitor for counterfeit products, unauthorized sellers, and brand abuse across e-commerce platforms while maintaining stable access.</li>
          <li><strong>Sneaker and limited release copping:</strong> Achieve high success rates on footwear and retail sites that block datacenter IPs. ISP proxies combine speed with residential trust.</li>
          <li><strong>Account creation and warming:</strong> Register and build reputation on platforms that require consistent IP history. New accounts need stable IPs to establish trust.</li>
          <li><strong>Streaming and geo-unlocking:</strong> Access region-locked content with stable, residential-appearing IPs that avoid VPN detection.</li>
          <li><strong>Long-running scraping sessions:</strong> Maintain authenticated sessions for extended data collection without IP rotation disrupting cookies and session state.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>ISP vs Residential Proxies</h2>
        <p>
          ISP and residential proxies both offer legitimate user IPs, but their underlying architecture creates important differences in performance, persistence, and pricing.

              <h3>IP Persistence</h3>
              <p>ISP proxies are static, giving you the same IP for weeks or months at a time. Residential proxies typically rotate, cycling through different IPs with each request or session. Choose ISP for stable identity; choose residential for anonymity through rotation.</p>

              <p>Both proxy types appear as legitimate ISP customers to websites.

              <p>ISP proxies charge per IP with often unlimited bandwidth, making costs predictable. Residential proxies charge per GB, which can add up quickly for bandwidth-heavy tasks. For high-traffic stable sessions, ISP proxies often provide better value.</p>
